# Security-Research
Independent security research focused on identifying critical vulnerabilities in enterprise systems through authorized testing and responsible disclosure.

## Research Areas
- API Security & Authentication Bypass
- Cloud IAM & Configuration Security  
- Payment System Integrity
- Supply Chain Security

## Representative Findings

### Enterprise IAM Exposure
- **Impact:** Critical authentication bypass affecting 2,000+ organizations across 6 continents
- **Technical Root Cause:** Unauthenticated API endpoints exposing global customer intelligence
- **Remediation:** Emergency auth enforcement, API gateway deployment, credential rotation
- **Business Impact:** Prevented existential business intelligence catastrophe

### Payment System Assessment  
- **Impact:** Transaction flow manipulation in the global retail platform
- **Technical Root Cause:** Weak API key validation allowing payment processing bypass
- **Remediation:** PCI-DSS aligned roadmap including request signing and JWT implementation
- **Business Impact:** Protected financial transaction integrity and regulatory compliance

### Cloud Infrastructure Security
- **Impact:** Privilege escalation and data exposure in multi-tenant environments  
- **Technical Root Cause:** IAM misconfigurations and over-privileged service accounts
- **Remediation:** Least privilege implementation and access control hardening
- **Business Impact:** Secured sensitive customer data and platform integrity

## Methodology
- Black-box security assessment
- API security testing
- Cloud configuration review
- Responsible disclosure coordination

## Key Metrics
