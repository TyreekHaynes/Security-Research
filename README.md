# Security Research Portfolio

Independent security researcher focused on identifying critical vulnerabilities in enterprise systems through authorized testing and responsible disclosure.

## üîç Research Focus

- **API Security & Authentication Bypass**
- **Cloud IAM & Configuration Security** 
- **Payment System Integrity**
- **Supply Chain Security**
- **Infrastructure Penetration Testing**

## üöÄ Representative Engagements

### Enterprise IAM Catastrophe Prevention
**Impact:** Critical authentication bypass affecting 2,000+ organizations across 6 continents  
**Technical Root Cause:** Unauthenticated administrative API endpoints exposing complete customer intelligence  
**Key Actions:** 
- Discovered exposed global client database through systematic API testing
- Demonstrated trivial exploitation requiring zero authentication
- Mapped business impact across Fortune 500, government, and education sectors
**Outcome:** Emergency authentication enforcement and complete API security overhaul

### Payment System Compromise Assessment  
**Impact:** Transaction flow manipulation in global retail platform
**Technical Root Cause:** Weak API key validation allowing payment processing bypass
**Key Actions:**
- Identified hardcoded API keys in production mobile applications
- Demonstrated complete payment flow compromise (authorization ‚Üí capture)
- Provided PCI-DSS aligned remediation roadmap
**Outcome:** Protected financial transaction integrity and regulatory compliance

### Cloud Infrastructure Security Review
**Impact:** Privilege escalation and data exposure in multi-tenant environments  
**Technical Root Cause:** IAM misconfigurations and over-privileged service accounts
**Key Actions:**
- Mapped attack surface across cloud and container infrastructure
- Demonstrated lateral movement through service account abuse
- Identified supply chain risks through third-party service analysis
**Outcome:** Least privilege implementation and access control hardening

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Methodology

My approach combines systematic reconnaissance with deep technical exploitation:

### Reconnaissance & Enumeration
- Multi-vector attack surface mapping
- API endpoint discovery through reverse engineering
- Cloud infrastructure and third-party dependency analysis
- Subdomain enumeration and certificate transparency monitoring

### Exploitation & Validation  
- Authentication bypass via protocol manipulation
- Business logic abuse and data exfiltration
- Infrastructure service exploitation (SSH, SMTP, DNS)
- Privilege escalation through misconfigurations

### Impact Analysis
- Business intelligence extraction and competitive risk assessment
- Financial impact quantification and regulatory compliance mapping
- Reputational damage evaluation and remediation prioritization

## üìä Research Metrics

- 100% responsible disclosure track record
- Multiple critical CVEs identified and remediated  
- Impact across Fortune 500, government, and education sectors
- Global scale findings affecting 6 continents

## üîê Responsible Disclosure

I adhere to strict ethical guidelines:
- Authorized testing only
- Immediate vendor notification upon discovery
- Detailed technical reports with reproduction steps
- Collaborative remediation support
- No public disclosure without vendor approval
