# Technical Security Assessment Methodology

## Overview
My security assessment approach combines systematic reconnaissance with deep technical exploitation to identify critical vulnerabilities in enterprise systems.

My standard approach to security assessments and is adapted based on specific engagement requirements and scope.*

Phase 1: Intelligence-Driven Reconnaissance
Goal: Map the entire attack surface like a sophisticated adversary

Category	Techniques & Tools
Attack Surface Mapping	Amass Subfinder Censys Shodan
Certificate Analysis	crt.sh CTFR Certificate Transparency
Cloud & SaaS Discovery	CloudBrute S3Scanner GitHunter
OSINT & Human Intelligence	theHarvester LinkedIn GitHub SocialScan
Endpoint Discovery	Burp Suite ZAP Mobile Security Framework
Phase 2: Targeted Vulnerability Analysis
Goal: Manual discovery of complex security flaws

Testing Area	Key Techniques
Authentication & Authorization	MFA bypass ‚Ä¢ Session hijacking ‚Ä¢ IDOR ‚Ä¢ JWT manipulation
Business Logic	Flow bypass ‚Ä¢ TOCTOU ‚Ä¢ Price manipulation ‚Ä¢ Workflow abuse
Infrastructure Security	Cloud IAM ‚Ä¢ Container escape ‚Ä¢ WAF evasion ‚Ä¢ Service hardening
Phase 3: Controlled Exploitation
Goal: Validate real-world impact through attack chaining

Kill Chain Stage	Demonstration Methods
Initial Access	Credential theft ‚Ä¢ XSS ‚Ä¢ SSRF ‚Ä¢ File upload bypass
Lateral Movement	Token reuse ‚Ä¢ Service exploitation ‚Ä¢ Trust abuse
Privilege Escalation	IAM privilege escalation ‚Ä¢ Container breakout ‚Ä¢ Domain admin
Objective Completion	Data exfiltration ‚Ä¢ Admin access ‚Ä¢ Business impact proof
Phase 4: Strategic Reporting
Goal: Translate technical findings into business risk

Deliverable	Components
Executive Summary	Business impact ‚Ä¢ Risk scoring ‚Ä¢ Executive recommendations
Technical Deep Dive	PoC code ‚Ä¢ Reproduction steps ‚Ä¢ Attack narratives
Remediation Roadmap	Immediate fixes ‚Ä¢ Tactical controls ‚Ä¢ Strategic improvements

Methodology Features
üéØ Intelligence-Driven: OSINT, threat intelligence, and attacker emulation

üîç Manual-First: 80% manual testing, 20% automated validation

‚ö° Evasion-Aware: Bypass WAFs, IDS, and detection mechanisms

üìä Business-Focused: DREAD scoring, financial impact analysis, compliance mapping

üìà Risk Assessment Framework
DREAD Scoring Model
Component	Scoring Criteria
Damage	Data breach, financial loss, reputation impact
Reproducibility	Consistency of exploit, required conditions
Exploitability	Skill level needed, tool requirements
Affected Users	User count, privilege levels, data sensitivity
Discoverability	Public exposure, authentication requirements
Remediation Timeline
Priority	Timeframe	Examples

üö® Critical	< 24 hours	RCE, authentication bypass, data exposure

üî¥ High	1-2 weeks	Privilege escalation, business logic flaws

üü° Medium	1-4 weeks	XSS, CSRF, configuration issues

üîµ Low	1-6 months	Informational leaks, hardening opportunities


‚öñÔ∏è Professional Framework
Ethical Guidelines
