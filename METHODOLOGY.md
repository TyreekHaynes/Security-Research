# Technical Security Assessment Methodology

## Overview
My security assessment approach combines systematic reconnaissance with deep technical exploitation to identify critical vulnerabilities in enterprise systems.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance & Enumeration

### Attack Surface Mapping
- Multi-vector infrastructure discovery
- Subdomain enumeration and certificate analysis
- Cloud asset identification and mapping
- Third-party service dependency analysis

### API Endpoint Discovery
- Client-side application reverse engineering
- Mobile application traffic analysis
- Administrative interface discovery
- Undocumented endpoint identification

## Phase 2: Vulnerability Identification

### Authentication & Authorization Testing
- Authentication bypass via protocol manipulation
- Session management and token validation testing
- Privilege escalation through misconfigurations
- API key and secret exposure testing

### Business Logic Assessment
- Data flow analysis and integrity validation
- Payment system transaction manipulation
- Supply chain vulnerability identification
- Access control bypass testing

### Infrastructure Security
- Cloud IAM and service configuration review
- Network service vulnerability assessment
- Container and orchestration security
- DNS and email security testing

## Phase 3: Exploitation & Validation

### Proof of Concept Development
- Reliable reproduction steps
- Impact demonstration without production damage
- Business risk quantification
- Regulatory compliance implication analysis

### Attack Chain Demonstration
- Initial access vector establishment
- Lateral movement path demonstration
- Privilege escalation validation
- Data exfiltration capability proof

## Phase 4: Impact Analysis & Reporting

### Business Risk Assessment
- Financial impact quantification
- Reputational damage evaluation
- Competitive intelligence exposure analysis
- Regulatory compliance violation mapping

### Remediation Guidance
- Immediate containment actions
- Short-term mitigation strategies
- Long-term security control implementation
- Security maturity improvement roadmap

## Tools & Techniques

### Reconnaissance
- Subdomain enumeration tools (Amass, Subfinder)
- Certificate transparency monitoring
- DNS analysis and zone transfer testing
- Source code repository scanning

### Vulnerability Assessment
- API security testing frameworks
- Custom scripting for business logic testing
- Cloud security assessment tools
- Infrastructure vulnerability scanners

### Exploitation
- Manual testing over automated scanning
- Custom proof-of-concept development
- Traffic analysis and manipulation
- Authentication mechanism testing

## Ethical Framework

- Authorized testing only
- Responsible disclosure adherence
- Minimal impact proof-of-concepts
- Collaborative remediation support
- No public disclosure without vendor approval
