# Technical Security Assessment Methodology

## Overview
My security assessment approach combines systematic reconnaissance with deep technical exploitation to identify critical vulnerabilities in enterprise systems.

My standard approach to security assessments and is adapted based on specific engagement requirements and scope.*

Phase 1: Intelligence-Driven Reconnaissance & Enumeration
This phase focuses on building a complete, multi-faceted picture of the target's digital footprint, just as a sophisticated attacker would.

Attack Surface Mapping

Multi-Layer Discovery: Subdomain enumeration (Amass, Subfinder), IP block analysis, and ASN mapping.

Certificate & Log Analysis: Certificate Transparency log monitoring (crt.sh) for historical and emerging assets.

Cloud & SaaS Identification: Automated fingerprinting of AWS, Azure, GCP, and SaaS assets (e.g., Slack, Jira instances).

Dependency Mapping: Identification of third-party CDNs, JS libraries, and supply chain dependencies.

OSINT & Human Element: Reconnaissance on employees (LinkedIn, GitHub) for password spraying and social engineering vectors.

Application & API Endpoint Discovery

Dynamic Analysis: Automated crawling of web and mobile applications (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP).

Static & Reverse Engineering: Analysis of client-side applications (JavaScript, Android APKs, iOS IPAs) to discover hidden endpoints and API keys.

Traffic Interception: Monitoring mobile app and thick client traffic to identify undocumented APIs.

Parameter Discovery: Brute-forcing and fuzzing for hidden parameters and GraphQL introspection.

Phase 2: Targeted Vulnerability Identification & Analysis
Moving beyond automated scanning, this phase employs manual, creative techniques to uncover complex flaws.

Authentication & Authorization Testing

Bypass Techniques: Protocol manipulation (HTTP verb tampering, parameter pollution), credential stuffing, and multi-factor authentication bypass (race conditions, status code manipulation).

Session Integrity: Testing for token predictability, improper invalidation, and session fixation.

Privilege Escalation: Horizontal and vertical escalation testing via Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), JWT manipulation, and functional-level access control flaws.

Business Logic Assessment

Flow Bypass: Identifying ways to skip steps in workflows (e.g., checkout processes, application wizards).

Data Integrity Manipulation: Tampering with price calculations, quantity limits, and integrity checks.

Time-Based Attacks: Exploiting time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU) race conditions.

Infrastructure & Configuration Security

Cloud Security Posture: In-depth assessment of IAM roles, S3 buckets, security groups, and managed service configurations using tools like ScoutSuite or Pacu.

Container & Orchestration Security: Testing for exposed Docker APIs, vulnerable container images, and misconfigured Kubernetes clusters.

Network Service Testing: Vulnerability assessment of exposed services with an emphasis on evasion techniques to bypass WAFs/IPS.

Phase 3: Controlled Exploitation & Attack Chain Validation
This phase proves the real-world exploitability and impact of findings by chaining them together.

Proof of Concept Development

Reliable Reproduction: Creating standalone, documented scripts or command sequences to reliably trigger the vulnerability.

Safe Impact Demonstration: Extracting non-sensitive data (e.g., system time, a non-PII database row) or achieving a non-disruptive, authorized state change to prove capability.

Attack Narrative: Framing the PoC within a realistic attacker scenario.

Attack Chain Demonstration (Kill Chain)

Establish Foothold: Demonstrating initial access (e.g., via a stolen cookie, weak credential, or XSS).

Lateral Movement: Using compromised credentials or service vulnerabilities to move between systems or user contexts.

Privilege Escalation: Achieving higher levels of access (e.g., user -> admin, EC2 instance -> AWS account).

Objective Fulfillment: Demonstrating the final attack goal, such as exfiltrating a sample of data or accessing a critical business system.

Phase 4: Strategic Impact Analysis & Actionable Reporting
This phase translates technical findings into a strategic business narrative and a clear path to remediation.

Business Risk Assessment

Quantified Impact Scoring: Using the DREAD model or a similar framework to score risks based on Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.

Financial & Legal Modeling: Estimating potential financial loss (fraud, fines), reputational damage, and regulatory implications (GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS violations).

Competitive Advantage Impact: Analyzing the risk of intellectual property or strategic data exposure.

Prioritized Remediation Roadmap

Immediate Actions (<24h): Step-by-step containment instructions (e.g., block IP, reset credentials, disable feature).

Tactical Mitigations (1-4 Weeks): Configuration changes, patches, and security control adjustments.

Strategic Controls (1-6 Months): Architectural changes, implementation of new security tools, and SDLC integration (e.g., mandatory security training, SAST/DAST pipelines).

Maturity Evolution: Recommendations for bug bounty programs, threat modeling, and red team exercises.

Tools, Techniques & Adaptive Execution
Tool Agnosticism: Expertise in a core set of tools (Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, custom scripts) with the ability to adapt and use specialized tools as needed.

Manual > Automated: A philosophy that prioritizes manual, intelligent testing (comprising ~80% of effort) over automated scanning (~20%).

Evasion & Stealth: Employing traffic malleability, timing delays, and user-agent spoofing to evade detection during engagements.

Ethical & Professional Framework
Strict Adherence to Scope: Unwavering commitment to the agreed-upon rules of engagement.

Responsible Disclosure: Following a clear, collaborative disclosure process with defined timelines.

Minimal Impact Pledge: All proof-of-concepts are designed to prove a point without causing damage or disruption.

Remediation Partnership: Offering support and retesting to validate fixes at no extra cost, ensuring vulnerabilities are fully resolved.
